I'm Ruilin Zhou, a CSE PhD student at UCSC. I'm broadly intersted in the area of quantum network, quantum computing and quantum cryptography. My current research is on protocol and model design in future quantum network. My advisor is Chen Qian. 

I recived my Bachelor's degree in Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications in Applied Physics and my Master degree from Northwestern University in Electrical Engineering.
