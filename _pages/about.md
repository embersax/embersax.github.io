I'm Ruilin Zhou, a third-year CSE PhD student at UCSC. I'm broadly interested in the areas of quantum networks, quantum computing, and quantum cryptography. My current research is on protocol and model design in future quantum networks, compiler and architecture of distributed quantum computing, and modeling and simulation for quantum networks. My advisor is Chen Qian. 

I received my Bachelor's degree from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications in Applied Physics and my Master's degree from Northwestern University in Electrical Engineering.
